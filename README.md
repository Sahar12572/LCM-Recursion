# LCM Calculator (Java, CMD-based)

This is a simple **Java console application** that calculates the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two integers using recursion to find the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**.

## 📌 Features

- Takes user input directly from the **command line** (CMD/Terminal)
- Uses recursion to calculate the GCD
- Applies the formula `LCM = (a × b) / GCD(a, b)`
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
