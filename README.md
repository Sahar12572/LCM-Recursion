# LCM Calculator (Java, CMD-based)

This is a simple **Java console application** that calculates the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two integers using recursion to find the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**.

---

## üìå Features

- Takes user input directly from the **command line** (CMD/Terminal)
- Uses recursion to calculate the GCD
- Applies the formula `LCM = (a √ó b) / GCD(a, b)`
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Compile the program** using your terminal:
   ```bash
   javac LCMRecursion.java
   ```
2. **Run the program** 
   ```bash
java LCMRecursion
  ```
3. **Follow the prompts:**
```bash
yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 18
The LCM of 12 and 18 is: 36
```
